  # Note: This group does not affect the script that turns on exterior lights
  #       when returning home. Entities triggering exterior lights on returning home
  #       are scripted in auto_lights.yaml (as it should trigger on any single member
  #       of group returning home, also if other group members are already home and
  #       the entire group's state has remained 'home')
